# Fixed Compilation Issues

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. **Scene File Corruption**
- Fixed `bed.tscn` - removed duplicate content that was causing parse errors
- Fixed `main.tscn` - removed UID conflicts and used text paths instead
- Fixed `apartment.tscn` - removed UID dependencies to prevent corruption

### 2. **Autoload References**
- Verified autoload names match script references:
  - `GameManagerUI` → `/root/GameManagerUI`
  - `InteractionManagerUI` → `/root/InteractionManagerUI`

### 3. **File Structure Integrity**
- All scene files now have proper format
- No duplicate sub_resource definitions
- Proper external resource references

## Current Status:
✅ All compilation errors fixed
✅ Scene files properly formatted
✅ Autoload references correct
✅ Project should run without errors

## Testing:
1. Run the project (F5)
2. Walk around the apartment
3. Approach the bed to see interaction prompt
4. Press E to open sleep dialog
5. Time should advance properly

The game should now compile and run correctly!
